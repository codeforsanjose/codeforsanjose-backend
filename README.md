## About

Currently the only brigade focused web solution is Laddr. I would like to build an alternative.

## Local Development

* Install Ruby 2.2.0 using either `rbenv` or `rvm`.
* Install `bundler`
* Execute `bundle install`
* Execute `rake assets:precompile`
* Execute `rake db:migrate`
* Execute `rails s`
* Access the front page at `127.0.0.1:3000`
* Access the admin page at `127.0.0.1:3000/admin`

## TODO:

* Everything
